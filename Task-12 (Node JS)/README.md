# 100 Days of Code Challenge

## Day 58: Exploring Express API

Today, I dived deeper into building APIs using Express.js as part of my 100 Days of Code challenge. Express.js provides a powerful and flexible framework for creating robust and scalable APIs.

In this session, I focused on the following:

- Understanding the core concepts of Express.js
- Setting up routes and handling HTTP methods
- Implementing middleware for request processing
- Parsing request bodies and handling data
- Responding with appropriate status codes and data

It's fascinating to see how Express simplifies API development and enables efficient routing and handling of client requests. The more I explore, the more I realize the potential it holds for creating amazing web applications.

Stay tuned for more updates on my coding journey! ðŸ’»ðŸš€
